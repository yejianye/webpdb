webpdb - Python Interactive Debugger with Web Interface
-------------------------------------------------------
webpdb is inspired by winpdb (a remote python debugger with a CLI and GUI frontend). Instead of using traditional GUI frontend, webpdb leverages the capabilities of modern web browsers. A web frontend makes cross-platform compatibility and remote debugging much easier. And users don't need to install thirdparty GUI libraries such as wxPython to run the debugger. 

The project is currently in development and has not reached a usuable stage.
